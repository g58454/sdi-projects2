    <h2>Project 3</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>I chose this theme because of my love for "Chomp Chomp". A fictional character from the beloved video game "Super Mario Borthers. Did I mention that I love him so much?"</p>
<p>Even thought this code is a basic make up of random information you would find in a game, it shows the complexity through simplicity of some of the most overseen bits of information.</p>
<p> I wanted to show that, with a little bit of imagination, your code can turn out pretty cool.</p>
<p>This is SDI 1401 Assignment Number 3</p>
